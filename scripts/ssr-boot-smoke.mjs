/**
 * SSR cold-start smoke test.
 *
 * Imports a template's built serverless SSR handler and asserts the
 * server module graph evaluates without throwing. This reproduces the serverless
 * cold-start: the runtime imports the handler at first invocation, and any code
 * that runs browser-only / SSR-incompatible logic at module scope throws here
 * instead of in production.
 *
 * Background: agent-native.com (and forms/slides/clips/videos/…) all 502'd in
 * prod because `@excalidraw/excalidraw` (which touches `window` at module load)
 * leaked into the Nitro server bundle and threw
 * `ReferenceError: window is not defined` at cold-start. Nothing in CI caught it
 * because no PR job boots a deploy bundle. This guard closes that gap.
 *
 * Pass/fail semantics — important:
 *   - The crash class we care about (a `window`/`document` reference at module
 *     scope) throws *during* module evaluation, which rejects the import quickly.
 *   - After evaluation, the handler may kick off async runtime init (DB
 *     connections, migrations, background services) that keeps the process alive.
 *     That is NOT a crash — evaluation already succeeded.
 * So: a thrown error during import => FAIL. A resolve within the evaluation
 * window without throwing => the crash class is absent. We then force-exit to
 * kill any lingering runtime init. The CI step also wraps this in an external
 * `timeout` as a backstop against a pathological synchronous hang.
 *
 * Each configured entry is the pure function handler (it does NOT call
 * `.listen()`), so
 * importing it evaluates the full server module graph without starting a server,
 * and needs no DATABASE_URL/env — the crash happens before any request.
 *
 * Boot budgets — the second reason this job exists:
 *   Not crashing is only half of "the cold start is healthy". Platform init
 *   scales with the deployed artifact: a 78MB Chromium that leaked into the
 *   server bundle (PR #2684) cost users seconds of TTFB on every cold Lambda
 *   and reached production because this job imported the handler and then threw
 *   the two numbers that matter away. So each template also asserts:
 *     1. how long the `await import(...)` itself took, and
 *     2. how many bytes the deployed function directory is.
 *   Both are hard budgets. There is no warn-and-pass tier, and a template we
 *   could not measure (missing artifact, unresolved import, no budget entry)
 *   reports NOT MEASURED and exits non-zero — an unmeasured template that reads
 *   like a clean run is exactly how this check would rot.
 *
 * Usage (after `NITRO_PRESET=<preset> pnpm --filter <template> build`):
 *   node scripts/ssr-boot-smoke.mjs [--preset <netlify|vercel|aws-lambda>] <template> [<template> ...]
 *
 * A target containing `/` is treated as a repo-relative app directory
 * (e.g. `packages/docs`) instead of `templates/<name>`.
