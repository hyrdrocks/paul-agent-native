/**
 * guard-no-boot-data-work.mjs
 *
 * These apps run as serverless functions, so a server plugin's startup body is
 * not "once per deploy" — it is once per COLD START, on the critical path of
 * the request unlucky enough to trigger it, and again on the next cold start.
 * Data work placed there is therefore paid over and over, forever, by users.
 *
 * This has cost real outages and sustained slowness, not hypothetical ones:
 * Slides startup slowness, Analytics paying startup cost on API calls, and a
 * production outage. The shape that did it looks like this, awaited in a
 * plugin's default export before anything can be served:
 *
 *   await migrations(nitroApp);
 *   await retypeBooleanColumnsOnPostgres();   // rewrites tables on Postgres
 *   await backfillLegacyClipsTables();
 *   await syncWorkspacesToOrganizations();
 *   await backfillRecordingOrgId();
 *
 * Schema DDL used to be exempt here, on the reasoning that migrations are
 * bounded and short-circuit cheaply. That was an assumption, and it was wrong:
 * on the Analytics production database (180 tables, 1920 columns) the migration
 * "fast path" measured 5.5s and the information_schema probe 8.3s. Health
 * checks timed out at 25s and the app was effectively down. The exemption is
 * how the pattern survived a cleanup meant to remove it — so there is no
 * exemption any more. Anything awaited in a plugin body is flagged, schema
 * setup included, and anything that truly must run first says so on the line.
 *
 * Where to put it instead — all three already exist in this repo:
 *   - a scheduled job / cron (see the `recurring-jobs` and `automations` skills),
 *   - a one-off CLI or script run at release time, deliberately, once,
 *   - lazily, behind the first caller that actually needs the data, memoized.
 *
 * Scope: only lines ADDED on this branch (via scripts/lib/changed-lines.mjs),
 * under a template's, app's, or package's server directory. The existing
 * boot-time backlog is a separate, schedulable cleanup — this stops the habit
 * from growing, which is the only thing a guard can honestly do.
 *
 * Opt-out, when the work genuinely must happen before serving and is bounded:
 *
 *   // guard:allow-boot-data-work — short reason
 *
 * Same diff-base contract as every guard built on changed-lines.mjs: if the
 * base cannot be resolved we say so loudly and exit 0, because a silent pass
 * here would look identical to a real clean run.

/**
 * SCHEMA DDL IS NO LONGER EXEMPT. This guard originally waved through
 * `migrations`, `ensureTable`, `ensureAdditiveColumns` and friends on the
 * reasoning that they short-circuit cheaply once applied. Measured on the
 * Analytics production database, which has 180 tables and 1920 columns:
 *
 *   SELECT 1                                  1.96s
 *   SELECT MAX(version) FROM …_migrations      5.47s   <- the "fast path"
 *   information_schema probe (ensureAdditive)  8.26s
 *
 * Every cold start paid that before it could serve, health checks timed out at
 * 25s, and the app was effectively down. "Bounded and fast" was an assumption,
 * not a measurement, and the exemption is exactly how the pattern survived a
 * cleanup that was supposed to remove it.
 *
 * So: ANY awaited call in a server plugin body is flagged. Schema setup that
 * genuinely must run before serving is still allowed — it just has to say so
 * on the line, where a reviewer sees it, instead of inheriting a blanket
 * exemption written by someone who never measured it.
