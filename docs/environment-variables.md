# Environment variables

This is the exhaustive maintainer inventory for Agent-Native. It covers
variables used by first-party runtime code, templates, build/deploy scripts,
and checked-in `.env.example` files.

The published [Agent-Native docs site](/docs/environment-variables) is a
curated framework/workspace reference. It intentionally leaves template-only,
provider-catalog, and CI/host plumbing out of the user-facing page.

The list is intentionally broader than the variables most applications need:
some entries are optional feature flags, local development controls, or
internal deployment settings. Do not set a variable just because it appears
here. Follow the owning feature's documentation and keep user- or
workspace-scoped credentials in the database-backed secret store.

The focused user-facing guides remain authoritative for their areas:

- [Deployment](../packages/core/docs/content/deployment.mdx#environment-variables)
  - production hosting, database, and framework configuration
- [Authentication](../packages/core/docs/content/authentication.mdx)
  - auth modes, OAuth, and static bearer fallbacks
- [Security](../packages/core/docs/content/security.mdx)
  - security-sensitive opt-ins and credential boundaries
- Template `server/lib/env-config.ts` files and
  `templates/analytics/app/lib/data-sources.ts`
  - settings UI and provider-specific credential metadata

For committed, non-secret app defaults such as first-run onboarding, prefer
`agent-native.config.ts` and use the [Agent-Native app configuration
guide](../packages/core/docs/content/agent-native-config.mdx) instead of adding
another `VITE_*` flag. `agent-native.ts`, `agent-native.mts`,
`agent-native.config.mts`, and `agent-native.json` remain supported. Keep credentials
and deployment-specific values in the environment or scoped secret store.

`runtime.environment.required` records environment variable names only. The
resolved config is public browser configuration, so set the corresponding
values in the deployment environment or secret store, never in the config file
or a committed `.env` file.

## How variables are loaded

Template development loads the template `.env`, then its `.env.local` override,
and workspace development loads the repository root `.env` before app-local
values. App-local values win when the same key is defined in both places.
`.env.example` files are starter files, not complete references; this page is
the completeness index.

`VITE_*` and `import.meta.env` values can be bundled into browser code. Treat
them as public configuration. Never put a secret in a `VITE_*` variable.

For credentials, use deployment environment variables only for deploy-level
configuration. User-, organization-, and workspace-scoped credentials belong
in the scoped secret/credential store or an OAuth connection. Never commit
values from `.env` files, and use placeholders such as `<API_KEY>` in examples.

## Common application and deployment variables

| Variable                                                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `DATABASE_URL`                                                     | Primary SQL connection URL. Local development falls back to SQLite when it is unset; production also accepts `<APP_NAME>_DATABASE_URL` or `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`.           |
| `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN`                                              | Separate database auth token for providers such as Turso/libSQL.                                                                                                            |
| `DB_CONNECT_COOLDOWN_MS`                                           | How long an endpoint stops attempting new connections after one attempt fails (default 2000, jittered). Prevents a refused attempt from immediately producing the next one. |
| `APP_URL`                                                          | Optional canonical public origin for auth, OAuth, A2A, webhooks, and generated links; hosting metadata is inferred when unset.                                              |
| `APP_BASE_PATH`                                                    | Server-side mount prefix for a workspace app such as `/mail`.                                                                                                               |

| `NITRO_PRESET`                                                     | Nitro build/deployment preset.                                                                                                                                              |
| `IS_RR_BUILD_REQUEST`                                              | Internal React Router build-time preview marker used during prerendering; do not set manually.                                                                              |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`                                               | Stable Better Auth session-signing secret for standalone production apps; workspace deployments can derive it from `A2A_SECRET`.                                            |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL`                                                  | Optional Better Auth public-origin override; known template/request context, `APP_URL`, and Netlify or Vercel metadata are inferred when unset.                             |
| `OAUTH_STATE_SECRET`                                               | Dedicated OAuth state-signing secret; falls back to `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.                                                                                                   |

| `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`                                           | Legacy app-local/shared secret encryption key. Prefer the dedicated workspace key for shared vaults.                                                                        |
| `WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`                                 | Stable encryption key for a workspace-shared secrets vault.                                                                                                                 |
| `WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY_PREVIOUS`                        | Previous workspace vault key during a rotation window.                                                                                                                      |
| `AUTH_MODE`                                                        | Local authentication mode selection.                                                                                                                                        |
| `AUTH_DISABLED`                                                    | Local/preview-only auth bypass; unset already means false, and it must never be used for a public production app.                                                           |
| `AUTH_MAGIC_LINK`                                                  | Set to `0` to force the email/password fallback; otherwise a ready email transport enables magic links by default.                                                          |

| `NODE_ENV`                                                         | Node runtime mode.                                                                                                                                                          |

| `NODE_*`                                                           | Node runtime and CLI options such as `NODE_ENV` and `NODE_OPTIONS`.                                                                                                         |

Database-specific `<APP_NAME>_DATABASE_URL` and
`<APP_NAME>_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` overrides are supported for workspace apps.

Production readiness is checked without returning secret values. The public
`/_agent-native/ping?configuration=1` probe reports missing or weak auth/A2A
secrets, production auth bypasses, local databases, invalid public origins,
and any keys declared under `runtime.environment.required` in
`agent-native.json` or a typed config file. The shared provider shell shows the
same report as a warning/error chip and can copy a remediation prompt for an AI
coding agent.
Set `diagnostics.failOnBuild: true` when a project wants a production Vite
build to fail on these findings instead of logging them.

## Framework and agent namespaces

These namespaces are intentionally indexed as families because they contain
many small, independently deployable controls. The exact keys are scanned by
`guard:env-documentation`, so adding a new key still requires it to fit an
existing documented family or be added as an exact entry here.

| Namespace / pattern                        | Scope                                                                                                                                           |

The analytics template's provider catalog also supports credentials such as
`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`, `BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID`,
`ANALYTICS_BIGQUERY_EVENTS_TABLE`, `AMPLITUDE_*`, `MIXPANEL_*`,
`HUBSPOT_*`, `GONG_*`, `APOLLO_API_KEY`, `CLAY_PUBLIC_API_KEY`,

`DATAFORSEO_*`, and `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`. These are provider credentials,
not deployment defaults; configure them through the analytics credential UI or
workspace connection when available.

Other template-specific values are covered by the suffix patterns in the
provider table (`*_URL`, `*_ID`, `*_PORT`, `*_TIMEOUT_MS`, `*_LIMIT`,
`*_ENABLED`, `*_PATH`, `*_ORIGIN`, `*_HOST`, `*_REGION`, `*_BUCKET`,
`*_ENDPOINT`, and `*_PUBLIC_URL`). Their owning template source is the final
authority for defaults and accepted values.

## CI-only variables

| Variable                      | Purpose                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_DB`                 | Database name for the ephemeral Postgres service container used by the Content DB test lane. |
| `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD`   | Auth method for that same throwaway container; `trust` keeps the lane password-free.         |
| `S2573_PGLITE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | Install prefix for the PGlite build used by the Content database row-migration lock test.    |

GitHub Actions also creates short-lived step handoff variables such as
`HEAD_SHA`, `MATRIX`, `PLAN_JSON`, `PLAN_URL`, `PR_NUMBER`, `RUN_URL`,
`ROLLBACK_SHA`, `ASSERTIONS`, and `RECAP_*`. They are workflow plumbing, not
application configuration. The secrets and vars used by those workflows are
listed in the workflow files under `.github/workflows`; values must be supplied
through GitHub Actions secrets/variables, never committed to this repository.

The following variables are set by the CI workflow for service containers and
integration tests only — they are not used in application runtime code:

| Variable                      | Purpose                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POSTGRES_DB`                 | Database name for the PostgreSQL service container used in CI integration tests.                |
| `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD`   | PostgreSQL host-based authentication method for the CI service container (e.g. `trust`).        |
| `S2573_PGLITE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | Override for the PGlite native binary install prefix used by the content-database lock CI test. |

## Dynamic environment keys

Some framework paths intentionally read `process.env[key]` after a key has been
selected from a registry or a template manifest. The complete dynamic sets
come from these sources:

- `packages/core/src/agent/engine/provider-env-vars.ts`
- `packages/core/src/secrets/register-framework-secrets.ts`
- `templates/*/server/lib/env-config.ts`
- `templates/analytics/app/lib/data-sources.ts`
- `.env.example` files in the template and workspace roots

Do not add a second ad-hoc resolver for a credential key. Register the key in
the owning manifest, document its family or exact name here, and route stored
user/org/workspace values through the scoped credential APIs.

## Keeping this index complete

Run the focused check from the repository root:

```bash
pnpm run guard:env-documentation
```

The check scans first-party runtime/config files, deployment files, GitHub
Actions workflows, and `.env.example` manifests. It ignores generated docs and
tests, then verifies that every static key matches an exact entry or documented
wildcard above. Add a specific entry when a new variable has semantics that are
not represented by an existing namespace or suffix family.
