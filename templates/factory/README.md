# Factory

Factory is the inspectable foundation for building agent factories: work goes
in one end, governed agent work and shipped changes come out the other, with
human intervention points you control. It can start with Slack feedback and
pull-request evidence, then grow to orchestrate product workflows such as
PRD -> design -> engineering -> release.

## What it does

- Polls a configured Slack channel and records new messages with thread and
  coverage metadata.
- Ingests read-only pull-request evidence from the existing ai-services read
  boundary.
- Evaluates editable prompt rules with hard structured guards and stores every
  decision append-only.
- Lets a human correct a decision, tune a rule, or explicitly approve bounded
  work from the Factory UI or the generic Agent-Native Slack bot.
- Starts configured Builder or harness work only through an approval action,
  deduped by Factory item, and reconciles signed callbacks and provider state.
- Surfaces missed callbacks, incomplete evidence, and timeouts as explicit
  states rather than plausible success.

The current implementation is deliberately observe-first and shadow-only.
Sensitive work remains human-gated: auth/session/identity, credentials/vault,
migrations, payments, security, and publishable `packages/*` changes. Factory
does not silently auto-merge, assign, or claim a provider action succeeded
without a terminal record.

## Configure Slack

Set `WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL` to an existing member of the Builder.io organization
that Dispatch uses. Factory does not need a separate organization: startup
finds that existing organization and seeds its organization-owned automations.
If Dispatch synced the vault into a different organization, set
`AGENT_VAULT_ORG_ID` to that existing org id instead of creating a new org.

Connect Slack in Dispatch or in Settings -> Integrations. Factory resolves
Slack, GitHub, Sentry, and Builder credentials from the shared workspace vault
and only uses matching deployment env vars as a last-resort fallback. All apps
that read shared `app_secrets` rows must use the same
`WORKSPACE_SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (or the workspace's existing shared
encryption fallback). Never copy raw tokens between apps or add a second
env-only read in a provider client.

In Factory, set the Slack workspace, channel ID, channel name, repository, and
polling switch. The default scheduler polls once per minute, evaluates a
bounded page, and preserves errors for reconciliation.

The generic Slack bot is wired to Factory. Mention `@agent-native` in a feedback
thread to inspect the linked item, explain its decision, tune a rule, or say
"do it now" to create an approval-gated run. The bot replies with an
inspectable Factory link when a human decision is required.

## Hosting

Production expects a direct PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`,
`WORKSPACE_OWNER_EMAIL`, and `FACTORY_PUBLIC_URL`. `AGENT_VAULT_ORG_ID` is
optional and is only needed when the deployment owner cannot reach the existing
Dispatch vault organization through membership. The Builder executor also
needs `BUILDER_AI_SERVICES_URL` and `BUILDER_PROJECT_ID`; its private key and
signed callback secret belong in Dispatch workspace credentials and are
resolved at runtime. The app remains observe-only until a human explicitly
approves a Factory item.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter factory dev
pnpm --filter factory typecheck
pnpm --filter factory test
pnpm --filter factory build
