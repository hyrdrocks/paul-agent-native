/**
 * Guards for on-demand `ensureTable()` DDL so the common already-migrated path
 * takes NO `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on Postgres.
 *
 * Lives in its own module (like `./widen-columns.js`) so stores can import it
 * without every `vi.mock("../db/client.js")` test needing to stub it: the
 * helpers resolve `isPostgres()` / `getDbExec()` through `client.js`, so a test
 * that mocks the client to SQLite (`isPostgres: () => false`) makes the
 * Postgres-only existence checks no-ops automatically.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * `ensureTable()` runs once per process on first DB touch. In a long-lived Node
 * server the cost is paid once and is invisible. In a Netlify `-background`
 * function the process is fresh, so this is the FIRST touch — and the
 * `CREATE TABLE`/`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` DDL it issues takes an
 * `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock on the shared Neon Postgres database. Behind a
 * concurrent connection that already holds a conflicting lock, that DDL can
 * block ~indefinitely (observed >16s hangs in the bg worker vs ~1s inline).
 *
 * The tables/columns are essentially always already present in production, so
 * the DDL is redundant in the hot path. These helpers let a store cheaply check
 * `information_schema` first and only issue DDL when something is actually
 * missing — and when DDL must run, wrap it in a short `lock_timeout` so a
 * contended lock fails fast instead of hanging.
 *
 * All of this is Postgres-only behaviour gated on `isPostgres()`. On SQLite
 * (local dev) there is no such lock problem, so callers keep their existing
 * behaviour there.

 *
 * ## Keyed per client, never process-globally
 *
 * `pgTableExists`/`pgIndexExists` accept an `injectedClient` because the hosted

 * whose own global DB may be absent or SQLite. A single shared `Set` would
 * answer one app's probe with another app's schema — a correctness bug, not a

 * schema. The flow:
 *
 *   1. `probe()` — cheap, lock-free existence check (pgTableExists / etc.).
 *      Already present → return `false` (nothing to do; the hot path takes NO
 *      lock).
 *   2. Missing → run `ddl` through `runGuardedDdl` (bounded `lock_timeout`).
 *      - DDL completed → return `true`.
 *      - DDL was swallowed by a lock-timeout (`runGuardedDdl` returned `false`)
 *        → RE-PROBE. A concurrent connection virtually always created the
 *        object meanwhile, so the re-probe usually now reports it present →
 *        return `true`. But if it is STILL missing, the required schema does
 *        NOT exist and we must NOT let the caller memoize success — so THROW.
 *        The caller's `_initPromise` rejects and the next call retries instead
 *        of running forever against absent schema.
 *
 * On SQLite the probe is always `false` (helpers no-op there) and the SQLite
 * branch of each store keeps its own create-then-catch behaviour, so this is a
 * Postgres-path primitive in practice. Returns `true` when the object exists
 * after this call (either pre-existing-after-timeout-race or freshly created),
