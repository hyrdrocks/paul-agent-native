/**
 * Cloudflare Queues transport for durable background runs.
 *
 * The Netlify handoff is an HTTP POST to a function url that carries its own
 * 15-minute budget. Cloudflare has no such url: a request-triggered invocation
 * is unbounded only while a client stays connected, and the foreground returns
 * immediately by design. A queue consumer invocation is the equivalent budget
 * (15 minutes of wall time, documented), so the handoff becomes a queue send.
 *
 * This module owns ONLY the producer half — resolving the binding and putting
 * one message on it. The consumer half is the generated Worker entry
 * (`generateCloudflareModuleWorkerEntry` in deploy/build.ts), which reads the
 * envelope written here, synthesises a request to the processor route, and
 * delegates to the same handler that serves fetch.
 *
 * Every failure mode here is a DISTINCT typed value, never a coerced success:
 * an unbound binding, a refused oversized payload, and a rejected send are
 * three different conditions with three different repairs, and the caller
 * degrades to an inline run on any of them.
