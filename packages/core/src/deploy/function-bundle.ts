 * Netlify has no shared-layer primitive: an extra function is its own deploy
 * artifact, so every emit has to place the whole handler bundle next to its
 * entry. Doing that with real copies wrote a byte-for-byte second `server/` per
 * function — hundreds of MB per workspace before the zip step ever ran.
 *
 * Hard links cost nothing on disk and are invisible to every reader
 * (zip-it-and-ship-it, the Netlify CLI, tar): a hard link IS a regular file,
 * unlike a symlink, which those readers may dereference, skip, or ship
 * dangling. Deleting the source afterwards (workspace deploy prunes each app's
 * build output) leaves the linked bundle intact.
 *
 * The clone shares inodes with the source, so never write in place into one:
 * remove the file and write a new one, as every emit here does. An in-place
 * write would land in the source bundle's bytes too.
 *
 * Symlinked sources are resolved before linking, so the clone is always a
 * regular file — see the note in `copyTree`.
